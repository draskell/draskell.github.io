      <description>Technical Utility Bookmarks These are some utility pages I keep bookmarked as technical references when developing. I&amp;rsquo;m going to treat this like an Awesome List, so it will be a work in progress as I add more bookmarks.
Crontab Guru The crontab guru takes the guesswork out of crontab schedules: crontab guru. Paste in an existing schedule you are debugging or check out the example page for suggestions that might be useful for a new schedule.</description>

      <title>The Inception of This Blog</title>

      <description>Welcome, I am using this blog to explore my interests. Anything that excites me enough to keep me up into the wee hours tinkering is fare play for the blog. Hence the title NightNoon, as in &amp;ldquo;Should I go to bed? No! It&amp;rsquo;s barely night noon.&amp;rdquo;
The site is built using Hugo which will serve as the first topic to explore for the blog. I&amp;rsquo;m taking a page from Simon Willison who has suggested blogging in bite size chunks and starting with TIL posts.</description>
