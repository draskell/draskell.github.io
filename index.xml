      <description>This left hand four finger exercise will lead you through every four finger pattern (permutation). The idea is to assign a each finger to a fret (ie the index finger on the 7th fret) and go through each of the 24 possible permutations. Start slowly then build up the speed, but keep it rhythmic, see how fast you can go. The trick to going faster is mastering slower speeds first.</description>

      <description>Technical Utility Bookmarks These are some utility pages I keep bookmarked as technical references when developing. I&amp;rsquo;m going to treat this like an Awesome List, so it will be a work in progress as I add more bookmarks.
Crontab Guru The crontab guru takes the guesswork out of crontab schedules: crontab guru. Paste in an existing schedule you are debugging or check out the example page for suggestions that might be useful for a new schedule.</description>

      <title>Bored Jar</title>

      <description>Bored Jar The bored jar is something my daughter and I made and is intended to address the complaining of children in a constructive way. My daughter is 6, but I think this idea works for kids 5-10. Very young kids love to play with the cards if they&amp;rsquo;re laminated too.
The best part about about jar is that it is the first bored activity. Next time your kid is bored on a rainy day sit them down in front of this site and have them make the game.</description>

      <description>Welcome, I am using this blog to explore my interests. Anything that excites me enough to keep me up into the wee hours tinkering is fare play for the blog. Hence the title NightNoon, as in &amp;ldquo;Should I go to bed? No! It&amp;rsquo;s barely night noon.&amp;rdquo;
The site is built using Hugo which will serve as the first topic to explore for the blog. In this change log style post I am taking a page from Simon Willison who has suggested blogging in bite size chunks and starting with TIL posts.</description>

      <description>About the Author ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Thanks for reading! I am a software engineer with a passion for data systems and supporting people in making use of data. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in R&amp;amp;D science, manufacturing, and healthcare. I love learning new domains, but I still get the most satisfaction out of what got me into software engineering: the look on someone&amp;rsquo;s face when you automate a part of their job that they hated doing or didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to do.</description>
