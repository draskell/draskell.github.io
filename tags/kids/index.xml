      <description>Bored Jar The bored jar is something my daughter and I made and is intended to address the complaining of children in a constructive way. My daughter is 6, but I think this idea works for kids 5-10. Very young kids love to play with the cards if they&amp;rsquo;re laminated too.
The best part about about jar is that it is the first bored activity. Next time your kid is bored on a rainy day sit them down in front of this site and have them make the game.</description>
